# Dog_breed_classification
A cnn model implemented using tensorflow that can identify five different breeds of dog
This model is not build to achieve high accuracy or real world implementation bu to learn how to use tensorflow and keras.


This model can only identify five types of dog breeds namely
1.French Bulldog
2.German Shepherd
3.Golden Retriever
4.Poodle
5.Yorkshire Terrier

It ends up having an accuracy = 0.9913 or 99.13% and loss =  0.0364
but this is only valid for photos which actually belong to these dogs
if you bring any other kind of photos to which the moddel has not been
exposed then the model misclassifies with exceptionally high confidence.
